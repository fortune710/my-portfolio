        Quality > Quantity. We only have a one page resume so the way we use the space there is crucial. I see a lot of people who put a lot of projects and/or experiences on their resume, but only have one bullet point of description. What is this telling the recruiter? Not much. Pick what is most important/ you are most passionate about/ is the most impressive and go into detail. At least two or three bullet points. And don't spend a bullet point on what technology you used to build it. Integrate that with another bullet point or include it next to the project name.

            Impact. Companies want an employee which will do impactful work. Instead of saying "I did X using Y" say "Because I did X using Y, the company accomplished Z". Or use metrics : "By doing X using Y, the percentage of Z went up from 10% to 25%." This shows that your work accomplished something.

            Don't list everything you've worked with once under skills. Put skills you are actually very strongly versed in. A company recruiter will know you can pick up C++ easily if you put Java. You don't have to include C++ to get hired. But saying you know a lot more than you do can easily turn against you.

            Minimize soft skills. Unless you have experience to back up (even if you do), listing soft skills unless they are measurable is a waste of space. No one is going to hire you because you put "Hard Worker" on your resume.

            Include something non-tech or interesting about yourself like a leadership position or volunteering experience. I went to a career fair, handed my resume to the recruiter, and they were impressed by my volunteering experience. That's all we talked about for 20 min and I got a call the same day for an interview. Companies don't want to hire a robot, they want to hire a person (good companies anyway). If a recruiter/interviewer relates to you on a level beyond SWE that will definitely help your chances.

            My preferred order: Education (include coursework, don't have to include GPA), Skills, Experience, Projects, Interests/Leadership

        Your skills section should just be a comma separated list. You can have certain sub-categories such as "Languages" and "Frameworks", etc. to organize it better. You don't need to give yourself a proficiency rating. Calling yourself "intermediate" or 4/5 in Java does not mean anything. What is "intermediate" for you can be completely different from what the HM considers intermediate.

            Bullet points should be 1-2 lines long. Use Quillbot and LanguageTool to help you paraphrase and shorten your bullets
            Aim for 1 sentence per bullet
            Bullet points should be ordered from most relevant/impressive to least, as some hiring managers only have time to read the first they should get THE BEST!
            Don't use personal pronouns i.e. I, we, us, my, our, their
            Don't end bullet points with periods. Bullet points != sentences
            Your bullet points shouldn't go further right than your dates
            Don't spill bullets onto the following line with only 1â€“4 words on it. It's an extreme waste of space. For example https://imgur.com/QCcZ792
            Don't allow words to wrap to the next line and get hyphenated

        Action Verbs
        Each bullet should begin with a strong, past-tense action verb:

        Led is the past tense of lead

        Good examples: analyzed, architected, automated, built, created, decreased, designed, developed, implemented, improved, optimized, published, reduced, refactored

        Bad examples:

        aided, assisted, coded, collaborated, communicated, executed, exposed to, gained experience, helped, participated, programmed, ran, used, utilized, worked on
        Don't use the verb utilize. 9/10 times that word will be attached to some disgusting Gordian knot of a sentence that says in 20 words what could be said in 10.
        superfluous/awkward/unnecessarily complex verbs: amplified, conceptualized, crafted, elevated, employed, engaged, engineered, enhanced, ensured, fostered, headed, honed, innovated, mastered, orchestrated, perfected, pioneered, revolutionized, spearheaded, transformed
        frequently misused verbs: leverage, enhance, utilize
